Welcome to the Bellhop Design System documentation! This comprehensive design system provides all the elements needed to create consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces for Bellhop applications.

## Documentation Structure

The design system documentation is organized into the following files:

1.  [**Overview**](00_Overview.md)  - Introduction to the design system and its principles
2.  [**Design Tokens**](01_Design_Tokens.md)  - Fundamental design decisions including colors, typography, spacing, etc.
3.  [**Components**](02_Components.md)  - Detailed documentation of UI components including usage guidelines
4.  [**Guidelines**](03_Guidelines.md)  - Design principles and best practices for implementation
5.  [**Implementation**](04_Implementation.md)  - Technical resources and code examples for developers

Additionally, you'll find a complete JSON file containing all design tokens:
